Build a lightweight image tagging system using a pre-trained CNN.

## Features
- Uses MobileNetV2 (transfer learning)
- CPU-friendly training
- Minimal dataset requirement
- Easy deployment

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Place images inside dataset/<class_name>/
3. Train the model:
   python train.py
4. Predict:
   python predict.py
